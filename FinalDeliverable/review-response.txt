We thank the reviewers for their helpful feedback and appreciate the opportunity
to improve our work in preparation for publication.

The chairs specifically asked for us to:

(1) Correct the description of Zhong and Su.  We have done so in section 1.  We
also added reference to the other suggested work, LHDiff, to the same section.
In the interest of full disclosure, note that we only added one of the two
LHDiff citations (for the research track paper, ommitting the tool description)
because of space pressure.

(2) Add reference to Martinez and Monperrus, 2015.  We have done so, and added a
paragraph to the end of section 4 to specifically compare our results.  Although
we do not have the space to add examples of replacements as suggested by
reviewer 1 (it's a great suggestion!) and agree that the results in Table 4 are
noisy, we hope that the correspondance between our results and those of Martinez
and Monperrus alleviates concerns about imprecision somewhat.

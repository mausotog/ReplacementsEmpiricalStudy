As some possible extensions of our work, the authors of this paper think that it would be valuable to create a model with a larger sample of data, both in depth and breadth, but the authors of this paper consider that in this case it is more valuable to give a major importance to breadth, since the model benefits more from diversity of different programmers and different projects, and not as much from a repeated pattern of bug fixing in a particular set of projects. This will also help to the fact that the model will be less likely to overfit the training data.
As an extension of section 2.1, we would like to dig deeper into why is the number of actual bug fixing commits so low, and what can be done to mitigate this. Since this error is causing a lot of noise to be introduced to every study that deals with similar regular expressions and who are trying to caught bug fixing commits, and they are getting almost a 40\% of their population to be not actual bug fixing commits.
As a next step for this study, it would be interesting to insert this model into GenProg's code and compare its performance with previous runs and also to different approaches to see how well it works with our approach.
